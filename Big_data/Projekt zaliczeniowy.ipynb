Źródło danych\n\n***Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loan Data***\n\nPaycheck Protection Program (PPP) to program pożyczek biznesowych o wartości 953 miliardów dolarów, ustanowiony przez rząd federalny Stanów Zjednoczonych w 2020 roku na mocy ustawy *Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act)*, aby pomóc niektórym przedsiębiorstwom, osobom samozatrudnionym, przedsiębiorcom jednoosobowym, niektórym organizacjom non-profit i przedsiębiorstwom plemiennym w dalszym płaceniu swoim pracownikom.\n\nOryginalny zbiór danych można znaleźć na [stronie](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares-act/assistance-for-small-businesses/sba-paycheck-protection-program-loan-level-data) US Department of Treasury. W pracy zaliczeniowej użyto zagregowany plik .csv, który znajduje się [tu](https://www.kaggle.com/susuwatari/ppp-loan-data-paycheck-protection-program).\n\nUdostępniając publicznie dane o pożyczkach PPP, [SBA](https://www.sba.gov/) - *small business administration* - zachowuje równowagę pomiędzy zapewnieniem przejrzystości amerykańskim podatnikom a ochroną poufnych informacji biznesowych małych firm, takich jak listy płac i dane osobowe. Małe firmy są siłą napędową amerykańskiej stabilności gospodarczej i mają zasadnicze znaczenie dla gospodarczego odbicia Ameryki po pandemii. SBA jest zobowiązane do zapewnienia, że jakiekolwiek ujawnienie danych o pożyczkach PPP nie zaszkodzi małym firmom ani ich pracownikom.\n\nPożyczki PPP nie są udzielane przez SBA. Kredyty PPP są udzielane przez instytucje kredytujące, a następnie gwarantowane przez SBA. W związku z tym, kredytobiorcy zgłaszają się do kredytodawców i sami poświadczają, że kwalifikują się do kredytów PPP. Autocertyfikacja obejmuje m.in. poświadczenie w dobrej wierze, że pożyczkobiorca ma potrzebę ekonomiczną wymagającą pożyczki oraz poświadczenie, że pożyczkobiorca zastosował zasady przynależności i jest małym przedsiębiorstwem. Pożyczkodawca następnie sprawdza wniosek pożyczkobiorcy i jeśli wszystkie formalności są w porządku, zatwierdza pożyczkę i przekazuje ją do SBA.\n\nMały biznes lub organizacja non-profit, która jest wymieniona w publicznie udostępnionych danych, została zatwierdzona do pożyczki PPP przez delegowanego pożyczkodawcę. Jednakże, zatwierdzenie pożyczkodawcy nie odzwierciedla ustalenia przez SBA, że pożyczkobiorca kwalifikuje się do pożyczki PPP lub jest uprawniony do umorzenia pożyczki. Wszystkie pożyczki PPP podlegają weryfikacji przez SBA, a wszystkie pożyczki powyżej $2 milionów będą automatycznie weryfikowane. Fakt, że pożyczkobiorca jest wymieniony w danych jako posiadający pożyczkę PPP nie oznacza, że SBA ustaliło, że pożyczkobiorca spełnia zasady programu lub jest uprawniony do otrzymania pożyczki PPP i umorzenia pożyczki. Ponadto, otrzymanie przez mały biznes pożyczki PPP nie powinno być interpretowane jako zatwierdzenie działalności biznesowej lub modelu biznesowego małego biznesu.\n\nPubliczne dane PPP obejmują wyłącznie aktywne kredyty. Kredyty, które zostały anulowane z jakiegokolwiek powodu, nie są uwzględniane w publicznych danych.\n\nDane pożyczek PPP odzwierciedlają informacje, które pożyczkobiorcy dostarczyli swoim pożyczkodawcom ubiegając się o pożyczki PPP. SBA nie może składać żadnych oświadczeń co do dokładności lub kompletności informacji, które pożyczkobiorcy dostarczyli swoim pożyczkodawcom. Nie wszyscy pożyczkobiorcy przekazali wszystkie informacje. Na przykład, około 75% wszystkich pożyczek PPP nie zawierało żadnych informacji demograficznych, ponieważ informacje te nie zostały dostarczone przez pożyczkobiorców. SBA pracuje nad zebraniem większej ilości informacji demograficznych od pożyczkobiorców, aby lepiej zrozumieć, które małe firmy korzystają z pożyczek PPP. Aplikacja o umorzenie pożyczki wyraźnie wymaga od pożyczkobiorców informacji demograficznych."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"109c6138-cb7b-4faf-b11a-e405331ada91"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#import bibliotek\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import isnan, when, count, col, mean, bround\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import unix_timestamp\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import TimestampType\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import *\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"de4106f0-183d-414c-8f79-5ad82736fd76"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# importowanie danych\ndf = spark.read.format(\"csv\").load(\"dbfs:/FileStore/shared_uploads/ud108519@student.sgh.waw.pl/PPP_data_150k_plus.csv\", header=\"true\")\ndisplay(df)"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"b7b7905b-c0ed-41b5-a791-a12e392bfff3"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"overflow":true,"datasetInfos":[],"data":[["a $5-10 million","ARCTIC SLOPE NATIVE ASSOCIATION, LTD.","7000 Uula St","BARROW","AK","99723","813920","Non-Profit Organization","Unanswered","Unanswered","Unanswered","Y","295","04/14/2020","National Cooperative Bank, National Association","AK - 00"],["a $5-10 million","CRUZ CONSTRUCTION INC","7000 East Palmer Wasilla Hwy","PALMER","AK","99645","238190","Subchapter S Corporation","Unanswered","Unanswered","Unanswered",null,"215","04/15/2020","First National Bank Alaska","AK - 00"],["a $5-10 million","I.
